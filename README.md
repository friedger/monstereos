## About

It's Just a Tamagotchi Game to show off EOS blockchain potential! You as an early adopter, will have a chance to carry a very old Monster while the game is in progress, getting cool functionalities and public traction :D

This project is a mini-game experiment for EOS Blockchain, still in progress. It's open sourced and all of us can tweak the contract, architecture and design of tables to see what works the best in terms of performance and good practices for EOS.

To keep your pet alive you must feed him, play with him, take him to the bed and wash him!

Only the feeding and sleeping/awake feature is done for now... There's a lot of interesting stuff that we can do here to improve the project like experience points (+ age and evolutions), inventory of items, multiplayer options, breeding, ownership transferring and tokenization.

We would love to have more and more developers to get in touch in GitHub repository, open issues, open discussions and so on, about what would be the best way to design the architecture and implement the contracts, how things should work in blockchain, how we should integrate Scatter, other wallets and provide top-security, what we should avoid, what's the best practice in terms of coding and everything else.

We love EOS Community and we think that we can build a better world together!
